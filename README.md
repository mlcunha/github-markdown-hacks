# Github Markdown Hacks

Showing some undocumented things you can do with Github Markdown to aid in README design.

## Why?

The readme is probably the most important file in a github repository if you're trying
to convey the value of your project's ideas to readers.

And of course, good design can influence a reader's comprehension and enjoyment of the content.
